# ZS-A4 v3 - Fan Shroud

I recently rebuilt my gaming desktop into a small 8.3L case. The case in question is a "sandwich" layout, which means that the motherboard, CPU, and RAM are on one side, while the GPU is on the other side! This is achieved with a PCI-e riser cable, and allows the GPU and CPU to both intake cool air from separate sides of the case.

The ZS-A4 v3 allows you to switch between five different backplates. I use the #5 plate, which fits a two-slot GPU and 65mm of CPU cooler. The cooler I use is Noctua's NH-L9a-AM4, which is a pretty low-profile cooler, and benefits greatly from a direct "path" to cool air.

This repository contains a couple of fan shroud designs to fit this cooler. Both are sized to take up the difference in space, and require the longer set of screws (the ones you would use for a 25mm fan). Differences are:

* v1 is a straight 92mm "pipe" design, going directly from the cooler to the case.
* v2 flares out without getting in the way of being able to secure the shroud. This is done at about 20Â°, to a diameter of around 104mm at the case side.

There's also a "hollowed" v2 that _in theory_ should save some plastic when printing, though the amount of plastic saved is honestly probably not that much. This is the version I have installed in my PC, and here's what that looks like! (It's not a great photo, but you get the idea)
