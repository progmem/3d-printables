# Chunithm LG Monitor Mount

Sometimes, you break a monitor. Other times, you just want a faster one. In either of those cases, this LG monitor mount is here to save the day, as long as it happens to be one of these monitors:

* 32GN50T
* 32GN50R
* 32GN500

## Materials

* Two 3D prints of the `lg-monitor-mount.3mf` model. Print this with thick walls (~4mm thick, 10 walls for 0.4mm nozzles) and decently thick top/bottoms (~1mm, 5 0.2mm layers).
* Four M6x6.35mm heat set inserts. [Here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TRJYLFT) is an example of some inserts.
* Four M4 30mm flat-head screws. There are many, _many_ sources for these, but [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0949K5VLZ) is what I used.
* A soldering iron with compatible heat set insert tips. These are going to be specific to your iron.
* Something flat and non-meltable that can sink heat and press against the heat set insert.

## Steps

Hackaday has a [great article on how to install heat set inserts into 3D printed parts](https://hackaday.com/2019/02/28/threading-3d-printed-parts-how-to-use-heat-set-inserts/). Please read this and familiarize yourself with the process before proceeding.

* Print two copies of the monitor mount.
* Into the larger of the holes, install the heat set inserts as suggested by the guide: use the soldering iron to sink the insert around 90% of the way in, then use your flat surface to press the insert flush to the surface of the mount. Hold the print to the flat surface for at least 30 seconds to give the insert and plastic time to cool.
* Run an M6 bolt (like one of the ones on the Chunithm cab) into the heat set insert from the side it was installed in. Run the bolt completely into and out of the hole to clear out any plastic that may've bunched up in the way.
* Connect your power and video cables. The mounts will make it harder to access the ports for these cables once installed, and this will also provide an opportunity for checking for clearances.
* Install the mounts on the back of the monitor horizontally, with the completely flat surface of the 3D print facing you. Each print will install into two holes on the left or right half of the monitor. They will look like a set of wings on the back of the monitor when installed correctly, with the heat set inserts not visible.

## Thanks

* MikaelTarquin for providing a list of compatible monitors.
* Horo for the original mount, which gave the dimensions that I could then use to make something not requiring a CNC or laser cutter.
