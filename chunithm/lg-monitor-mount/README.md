# Chunithm LG Monitor Mount

Sometimes, you break a monitor. Other times, you just want a faster one. In either of those cases, this LG monitor mount is here to save the day, as long as it happens to be one of these monitors:

* 32GN50T
* 32GN50R
* 32GN500

## Materials

* Two 3D prints of the `lg-monitor-mount.3mf` model. Print this with thick walls (~4mm thick, 10 walls for 0.4mm nozzles) and decently thick top/bottoms (~1mm, 5 0.2mm layers).
* Four M6x6.35mm heat set inserts. [Here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TRJYLFT) is an example of some inserts.
* Four M4 30mm flat-head screws. There are many, _many_ sources for these, but [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0949K5VLZ) is what I used.
* A soldering iron with compatible heat set insert tips. These are going to be specific to your iron.

## Steps

* Print two of these and install the heat set inserts into the larger of the holes, they should "bottom out" in the hole thanks to a ridge.
* Run an M6 bolt (like one of the ones on the Chunithm cab) through the hole to clear out any plastic.
* Install the mounts so they're like little butterfly wings on the back of your monitor, with the "flat" part facing you; you shouldn't see the heat set inserts.

## Thanks

* MikaelTarquin for providing a list of compatible monitors.
* Horo for the original mount, which gave the dimensions that I could then use to make something not requiring a CNC or laser cutter.
