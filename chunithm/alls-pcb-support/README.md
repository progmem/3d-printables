# Chunithm ALLS PCB Support Brackets

If you've managed to fit a very large hotdog (the ALLS) in a very small hallway (the Chunithm cab), you might realize that the ALLS doesn't exactly sit flat. Or, it might sit flat, unless you move it _just a little bit_ to the side. These brackets are here to help.

## Materials

* Two 3D prints each of the `alls-pcb-support-front.3mf` and `alls-pcb-support-rear.3mf` models. If possible, try to print this using a material that is more resistant to heat, such as PETG.

## Disclaimer

While these brackets help to secure the ALLS from moving around front-to-back, these brackets do not prevent side-to-side or 

## Steps

* If not already done, remove the Nu 1.1 and its wooden sled. Save the screws that are normally used to bolt the wooden sled securely down.
* With no cabinet PCB installed, place the two rear support brackets onto the wooden rails that normally guide the Nu 1.1's wooden sled in. Place one on each rail. Have the brackets pointing "inward" so the additional width they provide is going inward.
* Situate the ALLS into the Chunithm cabinet. The ALLS won't go in without doing one of the following:
  * Bend the tabs on on the PCB access panel hole.
  * Remove the entire front panel of the Chunithm cabinet.
  * Remove the lid from the ALLS, installing the PCB without that lid.
* Slide the front support brackets under the ALLS, lining up the holes on the bracket with the holes that normally bolt the Nu 1.1's wooden sled down. Bolt the bracket down using the existing screws.
