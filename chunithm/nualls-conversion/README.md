# Chunithm NuAlls Conversion

If you're here, you probably arrived from my guide on taking the guts of an ALLS and shoving them into the shell of a Nu 1.1! These parts are here to help with that.

## Materials

* One 3D print each of the `io-shield.3mf` and `psu-spacer.3mf` models.
  * If possible, try to print this using a material that is more resistant to heat, such as PETG.
  * The I/O shield is setup for multi-color printing to indicate the C/W, Front, and Rear audio channels.
  * The PSU spacer is a multi-part model consisting of the main spacer and an optional washer. Separate the model using your slicer of choice and reorient for optimal printing.
* Two M3 heat-set inserts, for the PSU spacer.
* Three #6-32 5/16" screws, for the PSU.

## Steps

The I/O shield is simply bolted onto the Nu 1.1 chassis with the use of the existing screws.

For the PSU spacer:

* Install two M3 heat-set inserts into the smaller holes.
* Place the PSU spacer into the Nu 1.1 case. Orient it so the large flat area is at the top and the recessed portion is facing into the case.
* Install two M3 screws into the top holes. Leave some slack, do not tighten these screws completely.
* Place the FlexATX PSU into the Nu 1.1. Orient it to fit into the recess on the 3D print. The side mounting hole should line up with the 3D print.
* Install two of the #6-32 screws in the lower PSU mounting holes.
* Optionally, place the included washer onto the remaining #6-32 screw and install it into the side mounting hole. The washer has a recess to clear the thickness of the Nu 1.1's metal.
